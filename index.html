    Other guests can choose from a variety of hotels in the city. Here are a few
    of our favorites:
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt><a href="https://theoaklanderhotel.com" target="_blank">The Oaklander Hotel</a></dt>
    <dd>
      The Oaklander is a 4-star hotel in the Oakland neighborhood, a short
      30-minute walk or 5-minute ride to the church and reception venue.
      Overlooking the Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh, it
      is near Schenley Park, Carnegie Mellon University, the Carnegie Museums,
      and the Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens. If you choose to walk
      to the wedding, we recommend
      <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/kjcTCstLBa723nhx5" target="_blank">taking Bayard St to Amberson Ave</a>.
    </dd>

    <dt><a href="https://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/pittsburgh-william-penn" target="_blank">The Omni William Penn</a></dt>
    <dd>
      Opened in 1916, the William Penn was once considered the grandest hotel in
      the nation. It is located in the center of downtown and is a 15-minute
      drive from the church and reception venue. It is located near PNC Park,
      the Andy Warhol museum, and the confluence where the Allegheny and
      Monongahela Rivers join to form the Ohio River. If you stay downtown, we
      highly recommend the
      <a href="https://www.walktheburgh.com" target="_blank">Walk the Burgh</a>
      walking tours for a fun dose of local history.
    </dd>

    <dt><a href="https://www.maverickpittsburgh.com" target="_blank">The Maverick</a></dt>
    <dd>
      Located in the historic YMCA building in East Liberty, The Maverick is a
      hip 4-star hotel located 6 minutes away by car or 35 minutes away by foot.
      They have a great cocktail bar and restaurant, and may be the most
      affordable hotel on this list.

  <h2 id="travel"><a href="#travel" class="silent-link">Travel</a></h2>

  <p>
    Pittsburgh is a small city by US standards, but we do have an international
    airport! We are quite far from other major cities, so we reccomend traveling
    directly to Pittsburgh.
  </p>

  <dl>
    <dt>Air Travel</dt>
    <dd>
      We reccomend flying into Pittsburgh International Airport (PIT).
      Pittsburgh has direct flights from most US hubs, including New York,
      Washington, Chicago, Atlanta, and Charlotte. Internationally, you can fly
      to Pittsburgh directly from Toronto, London, and Reykjavík.
    </dd>

    <dt>In Town</dt>
    <dd>
      Shadyside, the neighborhood of the wedding and reception, is very
      walkable. If you plan to visit other neighborhoods, Pittsburgh has Uber,
      Lyft, and a public transit system. The ride hailing apps will be your most
      reliable and convenient option. If you would like to use public transit,
      we reccomend the
      <a href="https://transitapp.com" target="_blank">Transit app</a>
      for planning trips and purchasing fares. Pittsburgh's iconic funiculars,
      the
      <strong><a href="https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/duquesne-incline/" target="_blank">Duquesne Incline</a></strong>
      and
      <strong><a href="https://www.visitpittsburgh.com/directory/monongahela-incline/" target="_blank">Monongahela Incline</a></strong>,
      use the same tickets as the rest of the public transit system.
