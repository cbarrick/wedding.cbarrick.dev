# Accommodation {#accommodation}

The wedding party and immediate family are invited to stay with us at
<a href="https://mansionsonfifth.com" target="_blank">**The Mansions On Fifth**</a>.
We have secured a block for all 22 rooms for both the Friday and Saturday
nights. Saturday night is on us.

Other guests can choose from a variety of hotels in the city. Here are a few of
our favorites:

<dl>
  <dt><a href="https://theoaklanderhotel.com" target="_blank">The Oaklander Hotel</a></dt>
  <dd>
    The Oaklander is a 4-star hotel in the Oakland neighborhood, a short
    30-minute walk or 5-minute ride to the church and reception venue.
    Overlooking the Cathedral of Learning at the University of Pittsburgh, it is
    near Schenley Park, Carnegie Mellon University, the Carnegie Museums, and
    the Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens. If you choose to walk to the
    wedding, we recommend
    <a href="https://maps.app.goo.gl/kjcTCstLBa723nhx5" target="_blank">taking Bayard St to Amberson Ave</a>.
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.omnihotels.com/hotels/pittsburgh-william-penn" target="_blank">The Omni William Penn</a></dt>
  <dd>
    Opened in 1916, the William Penn was once considered the grandest hotel in
    the nation. It is located in the center of downtown and is a 15-minute drive
    from the church and reception venue. It is located near PNC Park, the Andy
    Warhol museum, and the confluence where the Allegheny and Monongahela Rivers
    join to form the Ohio River. If you stay downtown, we highly recommend the
    <a href="https://www.walktheburgh.com" target="_blank">Walk the Burgh</a>
    walking tours for a fun dose of local history.
  </dd>
  <dt><a href="https://www.maverickpittsburgh.com" target="_blank">The Maverick</a></dt>
  <dd>
    Located in the historic YMCA building in East Liberty, The Maverick is a hip
    4-star hotel located 6 minutes away by car or 35 minutes away by foot. They
    have a great cocktail bar and restaurant, and may be the most affordable
    hotel on this list.
